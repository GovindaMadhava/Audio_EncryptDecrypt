    "Below is a python program to encrypt and decrypt any audio file using the cryptography library of python\n",
    "\n",
    "Cryptography is an encryption and decryption lib in python\n",
    "It is a key-based encryption technique, \n",
    "which means it generates a random key and this key is used in encypting and decryptoing data\n",
    "\n",
    "2 major techniques:\n",
    "A) Public key: 2 different keys used at the sender and reciever end to encrypt and decrypt data. Slower than private technique\n",
    "B) Private key: In this method, a single key(symmetric) is used for the encryption and decryption purpose at both the ends. \n",
    "Faster than public key method since one less key to generate and use in the process\n",
    "\n",
    "Installation:\n",
    "pip install cryptography :- to install the cryptography library\n",
    "\n",
    "This program can also be used to encrypt and decrypt images, Word docs, Notepad files by modifying the file extensions appropriately \n",
